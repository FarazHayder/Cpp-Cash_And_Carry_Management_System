# Cpp-Cash_And_Carry_Management_System
A fully functional Cash and Carry Management System, which includes; Inventory Management Module, Point of Sale (POS) Module, and Reports Module ðŸ›’

This is a console-based Cash & Carry Management System (CCMS), where the modules of inventory management, point of sale (POS), and Reports are implemented purely using C++. Some benefits of using C++ for this system include; high performance, platform independence, and access to low-level system resources. This system is made using programming concepts such as Input Validation, Looping (for loops, while loops), Conditional Statements (if-else), and Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Constructors, Destructors (though not explicitly shown, assumed), Member Functions, Access Specifiers (public, protected), Member Variables, Composition, Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA), and Function Overloading. The program is user-friendly with a good console-based UI, which is simple and easy to use as well as provides complete functionality.
