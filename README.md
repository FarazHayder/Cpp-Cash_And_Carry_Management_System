Welcome to the Cash & Carry Management System (CCMS) repository! This is a console-based system implemented purely using C++. It includes modules for inventory management, point of sale (POS), and generating reports.

## Benefits of Using C++
Some benefits of using C++ for this system include:
- High performance.
- Platform independence.
- Access to low-level system resources.

## Implemented Programming Concepts
The system utilizes various programming concepts, including:
- Input Validation.
- Looping (for loops, while loops).
- Conditional Statements (if-else).
- Classes and Objects.
- Inheritance.
- Encapsulation.
- Constructors.
- Destructors (though not explicitly shown, assumed).
- Member Functions.
- Access Specifiers (public, protected).
- Member Variables.
- Composition.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA).
- Function Overloading.

## User Interface
The program features a user-friendly, menu-based console interface that is simple, easy to use, and provides complete functionality.

## Usage
To use the Cash & Carry Management System, compile and run the `Cash&CarryManagementSystem.cpp` file using a C++ compiler. Here's how you can do it in bash:
```bash
g++ Cash&CarryManagementSystem.cpp -o CCMS
./CCMS
```
